  - Create an account (using 3rd party authorization preferably Google Firebase)

  - Sign in to that account (again using the 3rd party auth)

  - Create a player for the team (first name and last name)

__Tools to be used__\
Ruby to build site
Postgres database
Google Firebase authorisation
Theme provided [https://themeforest.net/](https://themeforest.net/)

## My Plan
__Things to get done__

- Had a quick look at Firebase

- Had a look at the required theme

- Emailed Glen requesting screen shots of his proof of concept

- Started looking at creating a rails test app to get re-familiarized (decided to get straight into the app)

- Created GitHub repo named teamapp-teamdb

- Researched using uuid with Rails found a great article showing how to automate adding uuid to each model - [https://blog.bigbinary.com/2016/04/04/rails-5-provides-application-config-to-use-uuid-as-primary-key](https://blog.bigbinary.com/2016/04/04/rails-5-provides-application-config-to-use-uuid-as-primary-key)

- Following Rails docs to get started with creating the app

- Created master branch with rails new, will branch off to dev and work off of dev branch
