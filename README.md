# Rubocop

To ensure strong adherence to the [ruby-style-guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide), we used a Ruby static code analyzer and formatter - **[Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop)**.

You can verify that your code matches the Ruby Style Guide and what's configured in `.rubocop.yml` by running:

```
rubocop
```
